# DESCRIPTION
# -----------
#
# This plugin helper sample script can be used for things like the SPE scaler
# tool to cooperate with QMC2. Of course, its use may be extended to whatever
# one may think of - it's just a script to make it easier to intercept the call
# to the emulator. However, the use with the SPE scaler for PS3 users was its
# initial motivation...
#
# This script will take care of special arguments for which QMC2 expects certain
# output from the emulator. When that's not necessary (we call it "game mode"),
# the script will call a helper program to execute the emulator on behalf of it.
# The rest is up to the helper program...
#
# To make this script useful, you'll have to change the default values below for
# both EMULATOR_PROGRAM and HELPER_PROGRAM.
