This is a derivative work from Shideravan System Template for QMC2, its purpose is to be a concise alternative for the classic Shideravan System Template using less resources and with a better performance and optimizations and visual experience as similar as been possible. 
Some features, such videosnaps support, translations and a customizable experience was dropped in favor of a better performance and a more direct approach, not needing any configuration.
I expect that it could be useful for you. 

Recommended for use with QMC2 0.58 and beyond.
