NAME
  qmc2-arcade - Arcade / non-desktop version of QMC2 - MAME/MESS/UME Catalog/Launcher II

SYNOPSIS
  qmc2-arcade [-emu emulator] [-theme qml_theme] [-console type] [-graphicssystem engine] [-language lang] [-config_path path] [-debugkeys] [-h|-?|-help]

DESCRIPTION
  For those who want to 'go straight into the games' there's QMC2 Arcade, a QML / QtQuick based approach to presenting an optionally filtered
  game- or machine-list, launching emulators in the same smart way that you're used to with QMC2's main GUI (see qmc2(6)).

  QMC2 Arcade usually loads within just a few seconds and is by far less bloated than the main GUI, trimmed to what's absolutely required.
  But although it's designed to run stand-alone, you must start QMC2's main GUI at least once prior to using QMC2 Arcade, because some of
  the file caches need to be created first - QMC2 Arcade doesn't take care of this itself, which is one of the reasons why it's so much
  faster. Also, you cannot change the emulator's configuration from within QMC2 Arcade. So whenever you want to make modifications to a
  game's/machine's configuration (or the global setup) you have to do this through QMC2's main GUI as well. 

  The main GUI also has a specific dialog for setting up all relevant back-end default options (-theme, -console, -graphicssystem and
  -language), for producing a filtered game/machine list used by QMC2 Arcade exclusively (optional) and for mapping key-sequences (also
  optional). Default values for back-end options can also be configured inside QMC2 Arcade provided the chosen qml_theme supports it (which
  all of the available themes do).

  Changed back-end default options will require a restart of QMC2 Arcade to take effect. Specifying them on the command line will overwrite
  the current defaults temporarily, but will not change their stored default values.

  The -emu parameter's value corresponds to the main GUI's three variants qmc2-sdlmame(6), qmc2-sdlmess(6) and qmc2-sdlume(6). As in case of
  the main GUI counterparts, selecting a certain emulator will make QMC2 Arcade use the settings specific to the chosen variant.

  Theme-specific settings are shared between all modes. That is, when a theme supports multiple emulators, it will usually look the same in
  each mode.

OPTIONS
  -emu emulator  Set the emulator mode QMC2 Arcade runs in. Available values for emulator are 'mame' (default), 'mess' and 'ume'.

  -theme qml_theme  Select the QML theme used for scene graphics, animations and/or shader effects. Available values for qml_theme are 'ToxicWaste'
                    (default) and 'darkone'. Note that there are currently no themes available for MESS.

  -console type  Choose the type of console to use. Available values for type are 'terminal' (default), 'window' and 'window-minimized'.

  -graphicssystem engine  Select the graphics sub-system engine instead of the currently set default one. Available values for engine are 'raster'
                          (default), 'opengl', 'opengl1', 'openvg' and 'native'. Note that this option only exists when QMC2 Arcade has been built
                          with Qt 4 (which is recommended). Qt 5 builds do not include it!

  -language lang  Choose translation to load. Run 'qmc2-arcade -h' for a list of available values for lang. Note that the default value for -language
                  is shared with the main GUI's language setting!

  -config_path path  Specify this argument to use the directory path instead of the default folder (CONFIG_PATH) to search for QMC2's configuration
                     and cache-files.

  -debugkeys  Enable debug logging for key-sequence mapping. Every recognized key or key-sequence will be logged to the console together with info on
              how the event is processed. Mapped key-sequences will cause event emulation, others will follow Qt's default event processing.

  -h|-?|-help  Show usage help, available options / values and their current defaults (for the given emulator mode).

FILES
  SYS_CONF_DIR/qmc2/qmc2.ini  System-wide default configuration (optional)

  CONFIG_PATH/qmc2.ini  Individual user's configuration
