DESCRIPTION
  Qt CHDMAN GUI - or qchdman in short - is a Qt based graphical front-end for CHDMAN, the 'MAME Compressed Hunks of Data (CHD) manager'.

  Future versions will also support some way of scripting to allow for freely customizable batch operations for repeating work.

                     configuration.
