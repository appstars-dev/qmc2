<h3>TODO - v0.2.b9, 18-MAY-2009</h3>
<p><b>Known bugs and restrictions</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Certain GUI styles may cause display problems for the emulator configuration widgets</li>
  <li>The ROM state filter cannot be applied to the hierarchical parent/clone view, because the display of clones depends on the display of their parents (this is a matter of principle)</li>
  <li>The joystick support introduced in v0.2.b3 also includes support for trackballs -- this is completely untested due to the lack of controllers with trackballs (it should basically work, but be prepared for bugs and unexpected behavior!)</li>
  <li>When a ROM check is active, the automatic track pausing of the audio player does not work. I have no idea yet why this happens and how to fix it, but it's just a minor issue anyway</li>
  <li>The icon sizes of all menu actions are not adjusted to the actual font size -- this is a Qt restriction, and I have not yet found a way to work around this restriction... however, it's also just a minor issue</li>
  <li>On UNIX / X11 platforms, the QMC2 variant launcher will try to raise a probably already running <i>other</i> variant -- this feature is <b>very</b> dependent on the window manager which may decide to ignore XMapRaised()</li>
  <li>Variant launching does not work on Windows yet</i>
  <li>MAME/MESS output notifications are not supported on Windows yet</i>
</ul>
<p><b>Work in progress</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>(De)activation and reordering of all available game/machine details</li>
  <li>Arcade mode -- partially working (disabled by default, use "make WIP=1 ..." for a preview)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Planned changes, new features and improvements for QMC2 0.2</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Improve ROMAlyzer: support for loading of CHDs and recalculating their checksums, add CHD management functions (using <i>chdman</i> as backend)</li>
  <li>Add a <i>demo mode</i> for MAME variants which runs random games for a selectable period of time -- requested by some cabinet users :)</i>
  <li>Add support for variant launching on Windows</li>
  <li>Add support for MAME/MESS output notifications on Windows</li>
  <li>Support dynamic loading of Qt style sheets</li>
  <li>Add a joystick &amp; keyboard configurator for MAME and MESS</li>
  <li>MESS device configurator: add a <i>device configuration generator</i> (generates configs from available files in a given directory the user selects) --
      add favorites management for device configurations --
      consider adding preview/flyer images for device configurations</li>
  <li>Add support for preview movies</li>
  <li>Provide freely configurable additional information sources (with individual markup and formatting settings), not only <i>history.dat</i> &amp; <i>mameinfo.dat</i></li>
  <li>Create an improved setup wizard with QWizard</li>
  <li>Add support for an emulator benchmark feature, probably including a server / DB application to store &amp; compare benchmarks from different users and systems</li>
  <li>Add optional support for the M1 sound emulator (only for the SDLMAME variant, though) -- if possible, via the M1 SDK; otherwise via the M1 executable</li>
  <li>Add a preview image / movie generator</li>
  <li>Use a clean semaphore mechanism for mutual exclusive operations (the current way of <i>flagging</i> is awful)</li>
  <li>Consider changing the document browser to a QWebView (QtWebKit module) so it will support external links (QWebView is a fully featured web browser)</li>
  <li>Consider adding support for nplayers and catver files for MAME (+ support sorting by game type)</li>
</ul>
