<h3>TODO - v0.39, 22-FEB-2013</h3>
<p><b>Known bugs and restrictions</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The built-in joystick GUI control includes support for trackballs -- this is completely untested due to the lack of controllers with trackballs (it should basically work, but be prepared for bugs and unexpected behavior).</li>
  <li>On X11 platforms, the QMC2 variant launcher will try to raise a probably already running <i>other</i> variant -- this feature is <b>very</b> dependent on the window manager which may decide to ignore XMapRaised().</li>
  <li>MAME/MESS output notifiers are not supported on Windows yet.</li>
  <li>The built-in <i>MiniWebBrowser</i> has a fairly restrictive set of features which is tailored to the uses of QMC2. It's not even <i>meant</i> to be a full-featured browser, even though it meanwhile supports most of the typical browser-functions.</li>
  <li>Depending on the complexity of a style / style sheet combination, it may slow down GUI operations (that's no bug, but you should note it).</li>
  <li>X11 only: Embedded emulators that change their display sizes at runtime (usually during startup) may not always be centered correctly.</li>
  <li>The 'set repair' function (a feature of the ROMAlyzer's checksum wizard) only operates on ZIPs! There's no support for ROM sets stored as unzipped files in individual sub-directores yet.</li>
  <li>Due to a Qt restriction, a QTabWidget's corner-widget (if any) is only shown when the tab-position is either 'north' or 'south'.</li>
  <li>Windows only: There's a known issue for <u>embedded</u> emulators running in <i>Direct 3D</i> mode ('-video d3d'): full-screen switching will lead to a crash of the emulator. To work around this, you have to <i>release</i> the emulator first; you can re-embed it later from the emulator control panel.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Work in progress</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Work has been started to eventually also support emulator embedding on Mac OS X -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#MarioSergio">Mario Sergio</a></li>
  <li>Adding a Swedish translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#DanielNylander">Daniel Nylander</a></li>
  <li>Adding a Greek translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Kostas">Kostas Albanidis</a></li>
  <li>Adding an Italian translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Stefano">Stefano Cereda</a></li>
  <li>Adding a Romanian translation (mostly done) -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Mihai">Mihai Boisteanu</a></li>
  <li>Adding a set rename tool to the ROMAlyzer which uses the -listxml outputs from both the old and the current emulator to gather the changes automagically</li>
  <li>Adding support for an optional ROM/CHD database which can be used to store unique copies of all (good) ROMs and CHDs and to retrieve complete sets from it to a local path -- among other things, this can be used to keep different versions of individual ROM/CHD files (due to changing sets) or to just keep your local ROM path clean</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Planned changes, new features and improvements</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>qchdman: add a <i>script</i> mode</li>
  <li>Arcade mode: add support for remapping of key-sequences and (digital) joystick-functions</li>
  <li>Arcade mode: add support for dynamically changing background images based on the current game's category (category images being freely customizable), add a MESS specific theme</li>
  <li>Port all uses of Qt Phonon to Qt Multimedia as Phonon isn't part of Qt 5 (not even planned for future releases)</li>
  <li>Add a <i>driver name</i> column</li>
  <li>Add a built-in PDF reader to directly support system documentation like <a href="http://www.progettosnaps.net/mess/" target="_blank">AntoPISA's MESS manual collections</a> -- note that we've already integrated <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/PDF.js" target="_blank">PDF.js</a> to accomplish this through QtWebKit</li>
  <li>Add support for <b>multiple</b> images per image category</li>
  <li>Add a nicer 'quick-search' function (replacing the default keyboard-search implementation inherited from QAbstractItemView) to all 4 game/machine list views and the software-list views including a pop-up editor to display and customize the search string</li>
  <li>Add extended (reg-exp) filtering for any textual data in any available game/machine list column</li>
  <li>Add <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/" target="_blank">YouTube protocol 3.0</a> support (currently 'experimental')</li>
  <li>Add support for state-checking &amp; -caching of software-list entries</li>
  <li>Add support for 3D arcade cabinet models from the <a href="http://www.mameworld.info/3darcade/" target="_blank">3D Arcade</a> project</li>
  <li>Add support for 7z-compressed ROMs to the ROMAlyzer and file-chooser</li>
  <li>Add support for optional coloring of some game/machine list item cells, especially for the driver status column</li>
  <li>Add support for <i>command.dat</i> from <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~plotor/" target="_blank">http://home.comcast.net/~plotor/</a></li>
  <li>Add a 'record a video' dialog to make the creation of emulator session videos an easier task</li>
  <li>Allow changing the order and visibility of any 'special' widgets (emulator &amp; front-end logs, emulator control, audio player and downloads + tabs on the software-detail widget)</li>
  <li>Add support to hide/show specific categories in both major game lists when the use of <i>catver.ini</i> (MAME/UME) and/or <i>category.ini</i> (MESS/UME) has been enabled</li>
  <li>Add an option to allow for automatic switching to the last viewed detail of each game/machine (do we really need that?)</li>
  <li>Add support for launching emulators in record &amp; playback modes (input recording/playback)</li>
  <li>Morph game/machine favorites, play-history and search results into tree-widgets (like the game/machine list views) and let the user categorize his/her favorites freely</li>
  <li>Add a backup / restore tool for QMC2's configuration and caches (though it's a trivial task, see <a href="faq.html#A2.17">Q2.17</a> in the FAQ)</li>
  <li>Add export / import functionality for YouTube video attachments (to allow for merging of videos found by different people, or to backup / restore discovered videos)</li>
  <li>Add a high-score database</li>
  <li>Add a joystick &amp; keyboard configurator for MAME and MESS</li>
  <li>Add support for MAME/MESS output notifications on Windows</li>
  <li>Add support for even more game/machine images (hiscores, howtos, ...)</li>
  <li>Create an improved setup wizard with QWizard</li>
  <li>Extend the template syntax to include the version an option was added/removed and process such options only if the current MAME/MESS version lies within this range (both new attributes will be optional, though, meaning that if they are omitted QMC2 will process the respective option regardless of the current MAME/MESS version -- just as it works now) (do we really need that?)</li>
  <li>Update MAWS quick download links: the cabinet artwork URLs are no longer found (since the latest MAWS site changes) (MAWS is down for quite some time now... if things don't change, we might drop/replace this feature)</li>
</ul>
