<h3>TODO - v0.2.b12, 20-SEP-2009</h3>
<p><b>Known bugs and restrictions</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Certain GUI styles may cause display problems for the emulator configuration widgets</li>
  <li>The ROM state filter cannot be applied to the hierarchical parent/clone view, because the display of clones depends on the display of their parents (this is a matter of principle)</li>
  <li>The joystick support introduced in v0.2.b3 also includes support for trackballs -- this is completely untested due to the lack of controllers with trackballs (it should basically work, but be prepared for bugs and unexpected behavior!)</li>
  <li>When a ROM check is active, the automatic track pausing of the audio player does not work. I have no idea yet why this happens and how to fix it, but it's just a minor issue anyway</li>
  <li>The icon sizes of all menu actions are not adjusted to the actual font size -- this is a Qt restriction, and I have not yet found a way to work around this restriction... however, it's also just a minor issue</li>
  <li>On UNIX / X11 platforms, the QMC2 variant launcher will try to raise a probably already running <i>other</i> variant -- this feature is <b>very</b> dependent on the window manager which may decide to ignore XMapRaised()</li>
  <li>Variant launching does not work on Windows yet</i>
  <li>MAME/MESS output notifications are not supported on Windows yet</i>
  <li>The MiniWebBrowser -- used for the MAWS lookup and the documentation browser -- has a fairly restrictive set of features which is tailored to the uses of QMC2.
      It's not even <i>meant</i> to be a full-featured browser. Nonetheless, as of Qt 4.5.2, the browser works quite well on UNIX and Windows (no idea about Mac OS X yet).</li>
  <li>Style sheets should only be activated if Qt 4.5.2+ is in use; Qt 4.5.1 works as well but has some QtWebKit related issues/crashes; Qt 4.5.0 shouldn't be used at all with style sheets</li>
  <li>Also, due to a Qt bug (as of 4.5.2) we have to change the current working directory (of the running application) to the style sheet's path to make sure that relative URLs (in the .qss file) are handled correctly. If you don't like that, use the <i>-stylesheet</i> command line parameter instead</li>
  <li>Another known issue with style sheets is that changing fonts at run-time doesn't work (unsure, but may be a Qt bug -- tested with Qt 4.5.1 and 4.5.2)</li>
  <li>Depending on the complexity of a style / style sheet combination, it may slow down GUI operations (that's no bug, but you should note it)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Work in progress</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Arcade mode: partially working, disabled by default (use "make WIP=1 ..." for a preview)</li>
  <li>Greek translation (thanks to Giorgos Kostopoulos)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Planned changes, new features and improvements for QMC2 0.2</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Fix case-insensitive obsoleteness checks (image- and sample-checks) on Windows -- bug tracker ID #5</li>
  <li>Fix web-cache compression on Windows (currently using no compression) -- bug tracker ID #4</li>
  <li>Add an option to bind specific emulator binaries to specific games (i.e. because of performance issues with newer emulator versions)</li>
  <li>Add a standalone or built-in template translator</li>
  <li>Improve the image checker to also support all additional image data (PCBs, control panels, cabinets, marquees and titles)</li>
  <li>Improve ROMAlyzer: support for loading of CHDs and recalculating their checksums, add CHD management functions (using <i>chdman</i> as backend)</li>
  <li>Add a <i>demo mode</i> for MAME variants which runs random games for a selectable period of time -- requested by some cabinet users :)</i>
  <li>Add support for variant launching on Windows</li>
  <li>Add support for MAME/MESS output notifications on Windows</li>
  <li>Use QDial instead of QSlider for the audio player's volume control when Qt 4.6 is out (see here for the great new look of Qt 4.6's QDial: 
      <a href="http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2009/03/31/a-new-face-for-qdial/" target="_blank">http://labs.trolltech.com/blogs/2009/03/31/a-new-face-for-qdial/</a>)</li>
  <li>Improve the encryption for stored passwords (weak now, but a warning is presented)</li>
  <li>Add a joystick &amp; keyboard configurator for MAME and MESS</li>
  <li>MESS device configurator: add a <i>device configuration generator</i> (generates configs from available files in a given directory the user selects) --
      add favorites management for device configurations --
      consider adding preview/flyer images for device configurations</li>
  <li>Add support for preview movies</li>
  <li>Provide freely configurable additional information sources (with individual markup and formatting settings), not only <i>history.dat</i> &amp; <i>mameinfo.dat</i></li>
  <li>Create an improved setup wizard with QWizard</li>
  <li>Add support for an emulator benchmark feature, probably including a server / DB application to store &amp; compare benchmarks from different users and systems</li>
  <li>Add a preview image / movie generator</li>
  <li>Consider adding support for nplayers and catver files for MAME (+ support sorting by game type)</li>
</ul>
