  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: skip unsupported CHD formats</li>
  <li>imp: pressing Qt::Key_Escape in the emulator configuration does no longer open the alphanumeric search widget, but will close it if it's currently visible</li>
  <li>imp: updated template format to include the two new option types <i>directory</i> and <i>file</i> (new format version 0.2.2)</li>
  <li>imp: code cleanup: replaced all occurrences of <i>getenv("HOME")</i> with <i>QDir::homePath()</i> as it is more platform independent</li>
  <li>imp: print warnings to the front end log if emulator audit calls don't exit cleanly</li>
  <li>imp: ROM check: set ROM status of remaining games/machines to <i>unknown</i> if the emulator crashes while auditing</li>

  <li>imp: main widget improved to allow for even more layout flexibility</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: changed some default settings to be more like "what the user expects"</li>
  <li>imp: earlier initial style setup, also circumvents a minor issue with the GTK+ style</li>
  <li>imp: worked around an annoying Qt bug that sometimes left the menu- and tool-bars at the wrong style or color palette (when changing the style dynamically)</li>

  <li>new: added new template for the original version of MESS on Windows (see data/opt/MESS/template.xml, initial version 0.130)</li>
  <li>new: added new template for MAMEUIFX32 on Windows (see data/opt/MAMEUIFX32/template.xml, initial version 0.131) -- use this template together with the MAME variant on Windows to cleanly support MAMEUIFX32 through QMC2</li>
  <li>new: added batch script for VC++ project file generation on Windows (see <i>scripts/generate-vcprojects.bat</i> -- preliminary, you'll have to adjust the path variables if you're going to use this script!)</li>
  <li>new: added new game/machine list setting called <i>DoubleClickActivation</i> to let the user enable/disable the start of an emulator on mouse double-clicks (may be annoying)</i>
  <li>new: build: added new <i>VARIANT_LAUNCHER</i> make option to enable/disable the QMC2 variant launcher at compile time (default: enabled on UNIX and Mac, disabled on Windows for now)</i>

</ul>
<p><b>v0.2.b7, 09-MAR-2009:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: ini-import/-export didn't work correctly when built for SDLMESS</li>
  <li>fix: clear search results list when search pattern is empty</li>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer: correctly reset the progress bar after analysing a game/machine for which the XML data indicates that it has no ROM files (MESS example: genesis)</li>
  <li>fix: corrected item cursor behavior in parent/clone hierarchy view on rapidly changing selections (i.e. when hovering over the list)</li>
  <li>fix: loading translations earlier now to allow for a translated welcome wizard</li>
  <li>fix: SDLMESS variant: store machine-specific emulator configurations in the [MESS] section</li>
  <li>fix: corrected a minor initial item selection issue for search results, play history and favorites lists</li>
  <li>fix: ensure a trailing slash for preview-, flyer- and icon-directories for paths returned by the directory selection dialog</li>
  <li>fix: corrected a series of bugs related to trimming the cached XML data -- if you don't update MAME/MESS when first using this (hopefully) fixed version of QMC2, it's recommended that you remove the gamelist- and XML-caches prior to starting QMC2 (the caches will be recreated <i>cleanly</i>)</li>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer: use full range of main progress bar</li>
  <li>fix: ROM state filter: correctly reset the progress bar after the filter has been applied</li>
  <li>fix: corrected a minor style setup issue on startup</li>
  <li>fix: ensure same minimum width for axis reset buttons of joystick calibration widget</li>
  <li>fix: honor <i>UpdateDelay</i> not only for previews &amp; flyers, but also for all the other game/machine details</li>
  <li>fix: ensure main window is initially visible and not obscured by the menu bar</li>
  <li>fix: install target works with spaces in paths</li>
  <li>fix: center main widget on desktop if its restore position is yet undefined</li>
  <li>imp: build: added installation of desktop entry files</li>
  <li>imp: build: added optional support to build against a <i>local / alternate</i> SDL library (see new make options starting with <i>SDLLOCAL</i>) - the default is to use whatever SDL library the system may default to</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME configuration template updated to 0.130 (no new options)</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMESS configuration template updated to 0.129 (revised several option descriptions, removed <i>remapjoys</i> and <i>remapjoyfile</i>, added new options <i>joy_idx1</i> - <i>joy_idx8</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: ROM status exporter: more SDLMESS specific updates to translatable texts</li>
  <li>imp: build: add qmc2.pro dependency for Makefile.qmake target</li>
  <li>imp: avoid potential locking during the determination of the emulator's version &amp; supported games/machines due to a probably failed reception of the sub-process' finished() signal</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: added more file status icons, log a warning on files with incorrect checksums</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: show count down in analyzer status</li>
  <li>imp: code cleanup: replaced all occurrances of obsoleted QWidget method setShown() with setVisible()</li>
  <li>imp: code cleanup: use constants instead of numbers for logical emulator options columns</li>
  <li>imp: automatically fall back to parent's game/machine- and emulator-info records when necessary/possible</li>
  <li>imp: build: even nicer compile output</li>
  <li>imp: more flexibility to layout the main widget (note that this can lead to unusable sub-widgets if you overdo what's possible :)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: colorize wrong checksums in red, unknown states in blue</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new <i>ARCADE_OPENGL</i> make option - if enabled (default), QMC2's arcade mode will support OpenGL (if available - direct rendering/hardware acceleration recommended!), otherwise only the software renderer will be available (should be fast enough, though)</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new <i>WIP</i> make option - if set to 1, unfinished code will be made available (default = 0/disabled)</li>
  <li>imp: updated redistributed Qt translations to Qt 4.4.3</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new <i>QT_TRANSLATION</i> make option - set this to the absolute path to your Qt translation files if you don't want to use the ones which are redistributed with QMC2 (which is the default)</li>
  <li>imp: welcome wizard: remove initial sample path setup for MESS variant because MESS doesn't support samples anyway</li>
  <li>imp: added distribution specific build configuration for <i>Mandriva Linux release 2009.0</i></li>
  <li>imp: use <i>-listfull '*'</i> / <i>-listxml '*'</i> (instead of just <i>-listfull</i> / <i>-listxml</i>) to determine the total number of supported games/machines and their detailed XML data - <i>some</i> MAME/MESS builds wouldn't report the full game/machine list without the asterisk</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: log elapsed time after analysis</li>
  <li>imp: improved full screen toggling of main widget -- should work generally better now and be more independent of the window manager</li>
  <li>imp: build: out-of-the-box build support for Mac OS X (Darwin) -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Vas">Vas Crabb</a>!</li>
  <li>new: log activation of joystick support and the run-time version of SDL (if applicable)</li>
  <li>new: show compile- and run-time versions of SDL in about dialog (if applicable)</li>
  <li>new: log run-time version of Phonon (if applicable)</li>
  <li>new: added new setting <i>ParentImageFallback</i> (default: false) to enable falling back to the parent's image if an individual clone's image doesn't exist (but the parent's image does)</i>
  <li>new: added optional/on-demand vertical status indicator in game/machine detail view</i>
  <li>new: added optional/on-demand display of game/machine description in preview &amp; flyer images</i>
  <li>new: added new setting <i>ShowMenuBar</i> (default: true) to control the menu bar visibility</i>
  <li>new: MESS: full device support through the new MESS device configurator, which is integrated into the main widget</li>
  <li>new: added ROM state filter toggles to the main widget, including new short cuts</li>
  <li>new: added new setting <i>CheckSingleInstance</i> (default: true) to enable/disable a startup check against multi-instance runs of the same QMC2 variant</i>
  <li>new: all QMC2 variants are now <i>separately</i> configured - includes automatic settings conversion (if required) and automatic cloning of a probably already existing front end configuration (from another variant)</i>
  <li>new: added <i>runonce</i> utility to project for use with the QMC2 variant launcher</i>
  <li>new: QMC2 variant launcher: both QMC2 variants (<i>qmc2-sdlmame</i> &amp; <i>qmc2-sdlmess</i>) can launch one another; if the <i>other</i> variant already runs, try raising it - note that this feature is <b>very</b> dependent on the window manager which may decide to ignore XMapRaised(); on KDE for example, it will only work correctly when <i>focus under mouse</i> or <i>focus <b>strictly</b> under mouse</i> has been set!)</li>
  <li>wip: arcade mode (not working in this release -- disabled by default -- use "make WIP=1 ..." for a preview)</li>
  <li>doc: added <a href="faq.html#A2.11">Q2.11</a> to FAQ</li>
  <li>inf: checked SDL 1.3 (experimental!) compatibility of joystick API</li>
  <li>inf: trying to build with Qt versions less than 4.4.0 is now completely inhibited!</li>
  <li>inf: long project name changed to <i>M.A.M.E./M.E.S.S. Catalog / Launcher II</i></li>
  <li>inf: build: compile time measurement is <i>disabled</i> per default now</li>
  <li>inf: there's nothing like an <i>emulator info DB</i> for MESS, so this feature is completely disabled in case of QMC2 for SDLMESS</li>
  <li>inf: project home page moved to <a href="http://qmc2.arcadehits.net">http://qmc2.arcadehits.net</a> -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Vincent">Vincent Bousquet</a></li>
  <li>inf: checked Qt 4.5+ compatibility (recommended due to much better performance!)</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.2.b6, 05-JAN-2009:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: startup crash on the creation of the template configuration map under certain circumstances (see tracker #2201714)</li>
  <li>fix: worked around a minor Phonon issue with duplicate metaDataChanged() signals</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME options template updated to 0.129 (corrected default value for <i>audio_latency</i>, revised several option descriptions, removed <i>remapjoys</i> and <i>remapjoyfile</i>, added new options <i>joy_idx1</i> - <i>joy_idx8</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: updated template format to include the template's emulator name (new format version 0.2.1)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: determine ROM file CRC identification troubles in ZIPs, log warnings and set the file status to <i>bad</i> in such a case (in contrast to <i>not found</i> as before)</li>
  <li>imp: code cleanup: changed several macro definitions to be consistent within QMC2's namespace</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new make options DISTCC, DISTCC_CC &amp; DISTCC_CXX (uses a distributed compiler such as <i>distcc</i> or <i>icecc</i> if DISTCC is set to 1 - check/set DISTCC_CC / DISTCC_CXX if enabled!)</li>
  <li>imp: slightly improved welcome dialog (logo, button icons and layout)</li>
  <li>imp: build: preserve existing system-wide configuration (usually /etc/qmc2/qmc2.ini) on <i>make install</i></li>
  <li>imp: build: avoid overwriting the Makefile when qmake is accidently called standalone (the project file now sets QMAKE_MAKEFILE to <i>Makefile.qmake</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: build: allow pretty compile output (doesn't work for RCC yet due to a qmake bug) - enabled per default, use make PRETTY=0 to disable</li>
  <li>imp: build: splitted CCACHECMD into CCACHE_CC &amp; CCACHE_CXX</li>
  <li>imp: build: use the same qmc2.pro project file for both debug and release builds (adding CONFIG settings dynamically on qmake call)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: log more CHD v3 header information (CHD tag, writable flag and parent's MD5/SHA1 checksums, if applicable)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: if <i>romof</i> is set in a game's XML data, but the file to merge is missing from this data (= <i>merge</i> attribute is empty), recursively search for the name of the current game's ROM file instead - MAME does exactly this in these rare cases (example: sfiiin)</li>
  <li>imp: ROMAlyzer: produce better status and log information on CHDs that were not found</li>
  <li>imp: allow higher values for <i>gamelist responsiveness</i> - setting this value higher than the total number of games will usually allow for less than 2 seconds of gamelist processing (at the expense of a more or less unresponsive GUI during reload, of course)</li>
  <li>imp: updated XML game info parser to support all current game/machine settings from MAME/MESS</li>
  <li>imp: many [Frontend] settings moved to [MAME] and [MESS] sections (automatically converted if the previous version is less than 0.2.b6)</li>
  <li>imp: code cleanup: make class and variable names emulator independent (i.e. use <i>EmulatorOptions</i> instead of <i>MameOptions</i>)</li>
  <li>new: added new SDLMESS options template (see data/opt/SDLMESS/template.xml, initial version 0.128)</li>
  <li>new: experimental support for SDLMESS (status: very basic and no <i>device</i> support yet)</li>
  <li>new: added plugin helper sample script for emulator startup interception (see scripts/plugin_helper.sh)</li>
  <li>new: all UI files regenerated with Qt 4.4's designer - Qt 4.4.0+ promoted as the new required version, although you may still be able to build it using Qt 4.3 in the short term - <b>Qt 4.3 is no longer supported!</b></li>
  <li>new: added tab icons for all main widget functions</li>
  <li>new: ROM status export tool with support for ASCII, CSV and HTML output formats - can output to file or clipboard</li>
  <li>doc: added <a href="faq.html#A2.10">Q2.10</a> to FAQ</li>
  <li>doc: added Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid) as an officially tested distribution to the FAQ (see <a href="faq.html#A1.7.1">Q1.7.1</a>)</li>
  <li>doc: added Fedora release 10 as an officially tested distribution to the FAQ (see <a href="faq.html#A1.7.3">Q1.7.3</a>)</li>
  <li>doc: added openSUSE 11.1 as an officially tested distribution to the FAQ (see <a href="faq.html#A1.7.2">Q1.7.2</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.2.b5, 16-OCT-2008:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: corrected a serious bug in ROM state and gamelist caching introduced by trimming the data - <b>please remove all cache files from previous releases before using this version</b>, otherwise QMC2 is likely to crash (rm ~/.qmc2/mame.lxc ~/.qmc2/qmc2.rsc ~/.qmc2/qmc2.glc)</li>
  <li>fix: corrected the shortcut scope of several actions</li>
  <li>fix: ROMAlyzer (cosmetic): don't start analyzing if the gamelist is empty</li>
  <li>fix: tool bar and status bar didn't show up on first start</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME options template updated to 0.128</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new make option PHONON (enables Phonon based features if set to 1, which is the default for Qt 4.4+)</li>
  <li>imp: revised a number of menu item texts</li>
  <li>imp: layout improvements for the ROMAlyzer (file I/O indicator now vertical)</li>
  <li>imp: code cleanup: prepend QMC2_ to SDLMAME macro internally</li>
  <li>imp: build: added new make options CCACHE &amp; CCACHECMD (uses ccache compiler cache if CCACHE is set to 1; default is 0 - check/set CCACHECMD if enabled!)</li>
  <li>imp: exchanged Qt logo due to Qt rebranding as of 4.4.3</li>
  <li>new: support for MAME output notifications via a named pipe (SDLMAME 0.127+)</li>
  <li>new: emulator control panel changed to a multi-column tree widget displaying more information like the game name, its LEDs (if applicable), the current emulator status and additional notifiers/values not handled statically (in a sub tree)</li>
  <li>new: added a <i>copy command</i> menu item to the emulator control panel's context menu to allow for easier copying of emulator command lines to the system clipboard</li>
  <li>new: individual joystick axes can now be enabled/disabled at will (this should make Sixaxis users happy :)</li>
  <li>new: the number of lines kept in the ROMAlyzer log can now also be limited</li>
  <li>new: optional support for background music playback (requires Qt 4.4+ / Phonon API - feature will be completely disabled for Qt 4.3)</li>
  <li>new: the boolean emulator option values <i>true</i> and <i>false</i> are now also translatable</li>
  <li>doc: added <a href="faq.html#A2.9">Q2.9</a> to FAQ</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.2.b4, 19-AUG-2008:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>fix: joystick mapping initially didn't work before the options were explicitly applied</li>
  <li>fix: keep game-specific emulator configurations open only as long as they are really needed</li>
  <li>fix: corrected support for keyboard shortcut mapping with multiple modifier keys</li>
  <li>imp: try to use system locale to setup the language if no language was specified (or if the language is unavailable within the translations); fallback to <i>us</i> as last resort</li>
  <li>imp: joystick test and calibration widgets are enclosed in scrollable areas now to allow for better handling of high amounts of axes or buttons; due to this, the layout management for these widgets was totally revised</li>
  <li>imp: minor speed ups for loading of XML and gamelist caches by reading data block-wise</li>
  <li>imp: SDLMAME options template updated to 0.127 (<i>yuvmode</i> replaced with <i>scalemode</i>, removed <i>cheat_file</i>, added new options <i>cheatpath</i>, <i>videodriver</i>, <i>audiodriver</i> and <i>gl_lib</i>)</li>
  <li>imp: code cleanup: use constants instead of numbers for logical gamelist columns, prepend QMC2_ to JOYSTICK and OPENGL macros internally</li>
  <li>imp: trimmed XML cache data - saves memory and disk space (plus adds a minor speed improvement upon cache reading)</li>
  <li>imp: build: check required Qt version on call to qmake (see qmc2.pro*)</li>
  <li>new: show number of (real/virtual) CPUs on system information page (about dialog)</li>
  <li>new: the frontend and emulator log browsers can now be limited to the amount of lines they keep in memory (the default is <i>unlimited</i> as before)</li>
  <li>doc: added <a href="faq.html#A2.8">Q2.8</a> and <a href="faq.html#A3.5">Q3.5</a> to FAQ</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>fix: if a null pixmap was retrieved, display the ghost image instead (of nothing)</li>
  <li>fix: under rare circumstances, the game specific emulator configuration wasn't updated correctly (empty widget)</li>
  <li>fix: positions of about dialog and doc browser were incorrectly restored on showEvent()'s</li>
  <li>fix: when switching between detailed gamelist and parent/clone hierarchy during reload, QMC2 crashed under certain circumstances (not absoluteley sure if this bug existed before or if it was introduced by new features of this release :)</li>
  <li>fix: avoid auto-selecting first game in list if switching views during gamelist reload</li>
  <li>fix: adjust icon sizes of shortcut redefinition buttons</li>
