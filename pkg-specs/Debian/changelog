qmc2 (0.2.b19+ppa1~maverick0) maverick; urgency=low

  * New Upstream release
  * fix: ROMAlyzer: corrected status determination for ROM files that have no dump (but for which the file size or any checksums are available through the XML data)
  * fix: corrected the scrolling behavior of the front-end and emulator logs
  * fix: MESS targets only: corrected ROM status determination for machines that require no ROMs
  * fix: correctly display document titles / title changes in the mini web browser
  * fix: MP3 player: corrected auto-repeating of pressed (and held) fast-forward / fast-backward buttons
  * fix: corrected MAWS web-cache compression (works also on Windows now)
  * fix: embedder: avoid left-over embed container widget when an emulator dies unexpectedly while it's currently being embedded
  * fix: demo mode: avoid saving game configurations while in demo mode (may crash)
  * fix: corrected the conversion to/from some (HTML encoded) special characters as used in a few game/machine descriptions and manufacturer names
  * fix: ensure correct parsing of XML attributes when retrieving game/machine details
  * fix: mini web browser: don't produce lower case URL patterns when validating entered strings
  * fix: corrected ROM cache updates on individual ROM status checks
  * imp: ROMAlyzer: improved performance for CRC identification of ZIP-archived ROM files
  * imp: ROMAlyzer: generally improved progress indication
  * imp: all logs are now based on read-only QPlainTextEdit's as this class is much better optimized for large amounts of plain-text data (compared to rich-text capabable QTextBrowser's, which were used before)
  * imp: SDLMESS/MESS templates updated to 0.141 (new option uifont, changed default value of writeconfig)
  * imp: SDLMAME/MAME/MAMEUIFX32 templates updated to 0.141u4 (new option ramsize for all, new options syncrefresh, bench and watchdog for SDLMAME)
  * imp: MESS targets only: for machines that require no ROMs, the ROMAlyzer will now display both their emulation- and file-states as 'good' (as opposed to 'unknown' / 'not found' which was used before)
  * imp: launching of BIOS sets will no longer be prevented (it actually makes sense for some of them) -- except in demo mode, where BIOS sets are never selected
  * imp: Windows build: revised the VC++ project generation script to be fully automatic and to also support VC++ 2010 (requires sed for Windows now!)
  * imp: support for additional XML data in game/machine details (tag and mask as sub-elements of configuration)
  * imp: embedder: when embedder maximization is turned on, the menu-, status- and tool-bars as well as the game-/machine-list status frame are now automatically hidden while an emulator is shown
  * imp: embedder: the embedder maximization toggle button now uses two icons to indicate the action taken when it's clicked
  * imp: updated redistributed Qt translations from Qt 4.7.2
  * new: ROMAlyzer: added a checksum wizard to search for SHA1 or CRC hashes in all sets, to qualify the states of the results and to repair bad sets from good ones (note: the set repair function works only for ZIPs at the moment -- create backups before using it!)
  * new: ROMAlyzer: if a ROM or CHD file that's expected to be merged from a parent set is loaded from the child set instead, a warning is logged (may be obsolete); the report will contain green (OK), yellow (warning) or red (critical) symbols to indicate the merge status
  * new: ROMAlyzer: added a set rewriter function to programmatically rewrite (clean) ROM sets on demand and/or while analysing them (works only for ZIPs!)
  * new: ROMAlyzer: the number of reported sets held in memory can now be limited (which is important for long batch runs where the memory consumption can otherwise grow enormously); the new default behavior now is that after 1000 analyzed sets the ROMAlyzer will start to remove the oldest reports
  * new: you can now select the position chosen by QMC2 when scrolling to the current game/machine item (the setting actually applies to all views & lists); the default is top (= old behavior)
  * new: all game/machine detail images now have a context menu with a 'copy to clipboard' item
  * new: added new compile-time setting BROWSER_PREFETCH_DNS to allow for prefetching of DNS lookups by the mini web browser (Qt 4.6 and higher)
  * new: embedder: embedded emulators can now automatically be paused when they are hidden and resumed when they are shown (requires the MAME/MESS notifier FIFO in order to correctly track any state changes)
  * new: embedder: the current status of an embedded emulator is now indicated through traffic lights in the respective tab widget header
  * new: added support for a 'number of players' column to the game/machine list as suggested by Francisco Javier Felix (csfax) -- see bug tracker ID #14
  * new: ROMAlyzer: added a 'copy to clipboard' function to copy the analysis output for the currently selected set to the system clipboard (as formatted text)
  * wip: completing the support for game/machine attached youtube.com videos -- note: this is a Qt 4.7+ only feature as it uses the embeddable youtube.com video player which in turn needs the npviewer browser plugin (and that's only cleanly supported since Qt 4.7)
  * doc: updated Q1.7.2 in FAQ to reflect openSUSE 11.4
  * inf: SDLMAME & SDLMESS targets only: the output notifier FIFO (/tmp/sdlmame_out) is no longer removed when QMC2 exits to allow for clean concurrent use by multiple variants (that's actually a work around because SDLMAME & SDLMESS both use the same FIFO, and there's apparently no portable way to find out if it's opened by another process to decide when it's eligible for removal)

qmc2 (0.2.b18+ppa1~maverick0) maverick; urgency=low

  * New Upstream release
  * fix: welcome dialog: the initial/optional hashpath setting must be stored under MESS (not MAME)
  * fix: Qt 4.7+ only: worked around a Qt bug that caused the first embedded emulator whose options were activated to disappear (visually)
  * fix: corrected concurrent/mixed joystick control when emulators are embedded
  * fix: avoid a QWebInspector warning by setting the application's organization name (only for builds with BROWSER_EXTRAS=1); as a result, QWebInspector will now correctly (re)store its settings in ~/.config/qmc2.conf
  * fix: corrected cursor positioning when editing strings in delegated item views (emulator configuration widgets and MESS device setup)
  * fix: avoid possible qUncompress() warnings due to empty input data
  * fix: embedder: corrected client resizing issues on maximized embedded emulators
  * fix: embedder: make sure the next visible embedded emulator (if any) gains input focus when the currently focused embed client is released
  * fix: set the codec for C-string conversion to the current locale's codec in order to correctly support unicode characters used in XML data (however, note that this makes the creation of XML- and gamelist-caches a bit slower)
  * fix: ROMAlyzer: just because chdman verifies the file integrity as good doesn't mean that it's the wanted file, so we still need to use the header checksums for comparison
  * imp: foreign emulator support: a working directory can now also be specified in the registration of foreign emulators (this was particularly added to support RAINE, but it's a good idea anyway)
  * imp: SDLMESS/MESS templates updated to 0.140 (no new or changed options)
  * imp: SDLMAME/MAME/MAMEUIFX32 templates updated to 0.140u3 (new options profile and bench for MAME, new option uifont for all, changed default value of coin_lockout for MAMEUIFX32, removed option volume_adjust for MAMEUIFX32, new option hashpath for all)
  * imp: UNIX build: forcedly disable pretty compilation output ('make PRETTY=1 ...') for Qt 4.7+ as it produces irritating (but harmless) shell warnings
  * imp: updated redistributed Qt translations from Qt 4.7.1
  * imp: embedder snapshot tool: the snapshot viewer now also hides itself when the escape key is pressed -- we're no longer bypassing the X11 window manager and are instead using a managed frameless window (the window manager must understand Motif and/or NETWM hints for this to work; however, most - if not all - modern WMs should be able to handle this)
  * imp: embedder: cleaner layout handling to avoid flickering borders due to auto-maximization
  * imp: ROMAlyzer: checksum columns will only be shown in the analysis report when their calculation has been enabled in the settings
  * imp: support for additional XML data in game/machine details (status for ROMs, disks and software-lists, optional for ROMs and disks)
  * new: embedder: the embedder options drop down menu now also contains a copy command item
  * wip: adding support for game/machine attached youtube.com videos -- will likely only work for Qt 4.7+ as it uses the embeddable youtube.com video player which in turn needs the npviewer browser plugin
