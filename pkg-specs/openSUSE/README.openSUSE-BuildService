Usage notes for the openSUSE build service
------------------------------------------

- Run "make dist" in the top-level directory first and upload the resulting
  archive (qmc2-<version>.tar.bz2)

- Choose one of the spec files in this folder (openSUSE-BuildService*.spec)
  and upload it as 'qmc2.spec'

- The build process will start automatically
