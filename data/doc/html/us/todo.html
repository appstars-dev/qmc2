<h3>TODO - v0.58, 23-NOV-2015</h3>
<p><b>Known bugs and restrictions</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li>The built-in joystick GUI control includes support for trackballs -- this is completely untested due to the lack of controllers with trackballs (it should basically work, but be prepared for bugs and unexpected behavior).</li>
 	<li>MAME output notifiers are not supported on Windows yet.</li>
 	<li>The built-in <i>MiniWebBrowser</i> has a fairly restrictive set of features which is tailored to the uses of QMC2. It's not even <i>meant</i> to be a full-featured browser, even though it meanwhile supports most of the typical browser-functions.</li>
 	<li>Depending on the complexity of a style / style sheet combination, it may slow down GUI operations (that's no bug, but you should note it).</li>
 	<li>Due to a Qt restriction, a QTabWidget's corner-widget (if any) is only shown when the tab-position is either <i>north</i> or <i>south</i>.</li>
 	<li>X11: Embedded emulators that change their display sizes at runtime (usually during startup) may not always be centered correctly. Unfortunately, newer window-managers may cause additional problems with resizing. We hope that we can avoid all of this with our planned embedder port to Qt 5.</li>
 	<li>Windows: There's a known issue for <u>embedded</u> emulators running in <i>Direct 3D</i> mode ('-video d3d'): full-screen switching will lead to a crash of the emulator. To work around this, you have to <i>release</i> the emulator first; you can re-embed it later from the emulator control panel.</li>
 	<li>Windows: MinGW builds: The GIF animation used when loading / filtering the machine list (or when <i>mass tagging</i> sets) isn't displayed in case of MinGW builds. We have no idea why, nor do we think it's our fault since in the official binaries built with VC++ this works fine (seems to be a MinGW-specific Qt bug). However, it's just a 'cosmetic' issue.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Planned changes, new features and improvements</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li>Fulfill the accepted/open <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/search.php?project_id=1&category=Feature%20request&status_id=50&sticky_issues=off&sortby=last_updated&dir=DESC&hide_status_id=-2&match_type=0" target="_blank">feature requests from our bug-tracker</a> (see also our <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/roadmap_page.php?project_id=1" target="_blank">current roadmap</a>)</li>
 	<li>Create a Qt 5 specific embedder (platform-independent with regard to embed handling, so will hopefully also work on Mac OS X)</li>
 	<li>Add a nicer <i>quick-search</i> function (replacing the default keyboard-search implementation inherited from QAbstractItemView) to all 4 machine list views and the software-list view including a pop-up editor to display and customize the search string</li>
 	<li>Add an optional reg-exp filtered machine list view (as an advanced alternative to the search feature)</li>
 	<li>Add software-state info to the software-list export feature</li>
 	<li>Add support for <b>multiple</b> images per image category</li>
 	<li>Add support for optional coloring of some machine list item cells, especially for the driver status column</li>
 	<li>Add support for launching emulators in record &amp; playback modes (input recording/playback)</li>
 	<li>Add a joystick &amp; keyboard configurator for MAME</li>
 	<li>Add support for MAME output notifications on Windows</li>
</ul>
